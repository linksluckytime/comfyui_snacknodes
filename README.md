Special thanks to the following projects and their creators:

- [ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts](https://github.com/pythongosssss/ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts) by [pythongosssss](https://github.com/pythongosssss)  
  The text processing functionality in this project is inspired by and builds upon the excellent work in ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts. Their implementation of string operations and UI display has been particularly helpful in developing our own text processing nodes.
